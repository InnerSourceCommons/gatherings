### InnerSource Activity 'xPalette' Unleashing Engineers' Creativity and Initiative

**Takahiro HIRUMA (Nomura Research Institute, Production Innovation Center, Platform Service Development Department 2)**

In an organization centered on software provision and maintenance services, drawing out engineers' creativity and initiative is essential for growth. This requires not just top-down promotion, but flat and open spaces where engineers want to participate. The InnerSource community 'xPalette', launched as such a space, is now in its fourth year. Through 'xPalette', the organization's capabilities (technical skills) have expanded, and member participation in projects utilizing these capabilities has increased. Furthermore, the creation of new businesses combining multiple capabilities is specifically progressing. This session looks back on 'xPalette's journey and introduces tips and practical examples useful for operating InnerSource communities.

### Why Are We Here - The Expression and Process in the Era of Individual Choice

**Yuki Izumoto (Scrum Master, KDDI Agile Development Center Corporation)**

In an era where each person chooses their organization - or about the commitment to expression and process for "why are we here" - or about KAGreement challenging culture formation through open communication and open collaboration.

Among countless companies in the world, why do we continue to work here? It's probably because there is compatibility and conviction between the organization and the individual. In other words, once that compatibility breaks down, we may feel anxiety or dissatisfaction with our sense of existence and identity within the organization. In response to such questions, let me talk about KAGreement, which is challenging culture formation with thinking very similar to InnerSource, incorporating my experiences and feelings.

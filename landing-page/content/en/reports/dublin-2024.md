The Dublin Gathering was planned as a small workshop for InnerSource practitioners and also as an opportunity to meet InnerSource Commons Executive Director, Russ Rutledge. 6 members of the Irish InnerSource community attended. We talked about the InnerSource activites we're currently engaged in. We workshopped a definition of InnerSource. We also discussed ways to build the InnerSource community in Dublin. It was a very productive and fun afternoon together!

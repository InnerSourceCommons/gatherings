<The successful gathering's report here! with images 😆>
The first InnerSource Commons Gathering in Paris was a truly memorable event, marking the beginning of a new chapter for the French-speaking InnerSource community. This inaugural gathering brought together 15 participants who will forever be remembered as "the glorious founders" of this journey.

The event featured excellent contributions from our local francophone community:

- François Nollen shared an inspiring InnerSource story from SNCF Connect & Tech 🚄, igniting meaningful discussions.
- Christian Paterson delved into the science of InnerSource with insights from the #ISPO framework ��, providing actionable takeaways.
- Boris Baldassari demonstrated how the OSPO Alliance's initiatives align with what the InnerSource Commons Foundation can deliver 🌍, paving the way for new opportunities for organizations embracing #InnerSource.
The gathering also welcomed Guilherme Dellagustin, a key member of ISC 🌟, whose presence added to the event's significance. A personal highlight was the participation of Silona Bonewald, one of the Founding Members and Directors of InnerSource Commons. Her vision and dedication to fostering collaboration continue to inspire the community 💡.

This is only the beginning! We are committed to continuing the development of the French-speaking InnerSource community. Join the conversation and connect with us on the #fr-general channel in the InnerSource Commons Slack: https://innersourcecommons.slack.com/

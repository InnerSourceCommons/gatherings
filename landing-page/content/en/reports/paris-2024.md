<The successful gathering's report here! with images 😆>
The first InnerSource Commons Gathering in Paris was a truly memorable event, marking the beginning of a new chapter for the French-speaking InnerSource community. This inaugural gathering brought together 15 participants who will forever be remembered as "the glorious founders" of this journey.
The event took place in a dedicated side room alongside the Open Source Experience conference at the Palais des Congrès in Paris, creating a vibrant atmosphere for collaboration and exchange.

It featured excellent contributions from our local francophone community:
- François Nollen shared an inspiring InnerSource story from SNCF Connect & Tech 🚄, igniting meaningful discussions.
- Christian Paterson delved into the science of InnerSource with insights from his experience building OSPOs and ISPOs, providing actionable takeaways.
- Boris Baldassari demonstrated how the OSPO Alliance's initiatives align with what the InnerSource Commons Foundation can deliver 🌍, paving the way for new opportunities for organizations embracing #InnerSource.
The gathering also welcomed Guilherme Dellagustin, a key member of ISC 🌟, whose presence added to the event's significance. A personal highlight was the participation of Silona Bonewald, one of the Founding Members and Directors of InnerSource Commons. Her vision and dedication to fostering collaboration continue to inspire the community 💡.

This is only the beginning! We are committed to continuing the development of the French-speaking InnerSource community. Join the conversation and connect with us on the #fr-general channel in the InnerSource Commons Slack: https://innersourcecommons.slack.com/

The discussion centred on:

* practical experiences of adopting **InnerSource** inside French-speaking organisations
* common hurdles teams encounter when opening internal code for cross-team collaboration
* the positive cultural shiftsâ€”greater transparency, faster onboarding, and stronger developer engagementâ€”that InnerSource is already driving

Session details are available on the Devoxx programme site.

#### Programme highlights

* **Facilitated round-tables** led by **Florent Zara** (Eclipse Foundation) and **FranÃ§ois Nollen** (SNCF Connect & Tech) guided participants through success stories and pain points, ensuring a vibrant, solution-oriented dialogue.
* The gathering recognised **Matthieu Vincent** (Sopra Steria), whose planned contribution was missed due to illness.
* Throughout the evening, attendees exchanged concrete tactics for scaling InnerSource practicesâ€”from lightweight contribution guidelines to metrics for measuring cultural impact.

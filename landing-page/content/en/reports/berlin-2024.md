"In June I'll be in Berlin - would you have time for a shared lunch break?" - it felt like ages ago that I had last met Peter, a fellow ASF member. Over tasty Asian food we discussed what we had been up to in recent years. Based on InnerSource' ability to build bridges across team boundaries, turn passive users into active contributors the idea was born to on a Spring 2025 Berlin Gathering: Co-located with <a href="https://25.foss-backstage.de/">FOSS Backstage</a>, a conference on all things non-coding Open Source - think funding, community, security. 

As several people could make it to Berlin in September 2024 in person, I booked a room at <a href="https://europace.de/">Europace AG</a>. In total roughly 10 InnerSource Commons members and InnerSource practitioners gathered. In the morning we discussed the InnerSource landscape in Germany: Who do we know is using InnerSource? Who is helping others adopt the practice? Who else should be on our radar? In the afternoon we discussed specific challenges teams are faced with when starting to adopt InnerSource patterns. Several practitioners on the intersection of open source and InnerSource are currently actively helping corporations identify InnerSource patterns that can help their challenges.

The conclusion of the day was a committment to use the next Spring gathering as an oportunity to reach out to people potentially interested in the tools and patterns that InnerSource has to offer and bring them together for a FOSS Backstage co-located InnerSource Spring Gathering. See you there - and if you would like to help get that Gathering off the ground, let me know.

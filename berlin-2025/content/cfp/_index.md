# Call for Presentations

Join us for one day full of learning and discussing InnerSource – how corporations can benefit from adopting Open Source collaboration practices and start their journey towards contributors of Open Source projects.

Please <b><u>[submit your talk](https://forms.gle/HJw5TFS9tzggPXRk8)</u></b> online!


The <b>Berlin InnerSource Gathering</b> – taking place on <b>12th March</b> in Berlin/ Germany – thrives on your contributions. We are looking forward to your talks and your participation of the afternoon Barcamp. If you have a special wish of a topic or speaker that we should try and get – please let us know as well.

We are looking for talks and workshops which teach about <b>InnerSource patterns, case studies, lessons learned</b>.

<ul> 
<li>Tell us about how InnerSource helped transform your teams to cross collaborate. 
<li>Get people together in a panel to discuss challenges and potentials of InnerSource.
<li>How did InnerSource help your teams become active in their upstream Open Source dependencies?
<li>Organise a pattern writing workshop where you work to create a new one or improve an existing InnerSource pattern.
<li>How did you work with stakeholders that lack Open Source experience, how did you explain InnerSource to them?
<li>What role do product managers play in your InnerSource program?
<li>Which of your Open Source learnings did you transfer to in-house teams even if you do not call that InnerSource?
<li>Connect the InnerSource program with other IT topics like Cloud Natives, Development, Architecture, Agile or DevOps-Culture
</ul>

Related topics not explicitly listed above are of course welcome as well. We do not, however, accept product presentations or company marketing pitches. If you are seeking to market your company at the InnerSource Gathering, we’ll be delighted to send you our sponsoring prospectus and discuss all the benefits that a sponsorship entails.

## Formats

We are offering the the following formats at the InnerSource Gathering:

* Talk (30 min) ... Talks are the standard session format at the InnerSource Gathering mornings. You present your topic in front of the audience within 30min. Please include time for Q&A.
* Panel (40 min) ... Panels are onstage discussions between a group of experts. Please provide contact details for all participants of your panel when submitting a panel discussion in our CfP.
* Off Stage ... This could be a piece of art, a performance or a hardware demonstration that doesn't need to be presented on a stage.

## Rules & Guidelines

If you want to submit your proposal for the InnerSource Gathering, please consider the following:
Rules

* We don‘t allow product presentations or company marketing pitches. 
* You are not allowed to switch the topic or content of the talk after the CfP submission period is over, except for in emergencies. If the topic is swapped after the CfP is concluded, the talk needs to be reviewed by the program committee again. 
* All Co-speakers have to be declared before the CfP submission period ends. Cospeakers that are added after the CfP is concluded do not receive free conference tickets and we reserve the right to reject the addition of cospeakers after the CfP. 
* We require direct email contact to our speakers for planing purposes. 
* By submitting your proposal, you consent that your talk title and description along with your photo and biography will be made publicly available, if your session is accepted. Talks will be recorded and recordings will be made publicly available on our YouTube-Channel. 
* Due to budgetary constraints, we cannot cover costs for travel or accommodation for our speakers. 

## Guidelines

Make sure you take the following guidelines to heart:

* Titles should be descriptive and must be less than 60 characters long. 
* The abstract and talk description is the most important part of your proposal, since talks will be rated by our program committee on the basis of those. A good abstract contains a focused description of your talk and explains why your topic is relevant. 
* The talk description is a more detailed look into your session: What will you be talking about? What will the audience learn? etc 
* Please don’t include your biography or personal details in your abstract, since personal information will be removed before the review process starts to avoid bias. 
* Title and abstract of your talk will be visible to everyone and will be used on our talk description pages if your proposal is accepted, so be sure to write a clear and concise abstract in full sentences and don’t just use bullet points. 


## Procedures

All submissions will be reviewed blindly, meaning that the program committee is unable to see the submitter’s personal details. Only the title of the talk and the describing abstract will be visible to the reviewers in order to reduce unconscious bias. After all talks are rated, we will inform you about the status of your submission. Talks can either be accepted, rejected or waitlisted. In case your talk is waitlisted, we will message you if a speaking slot opens up before the conference.

## First time speakers

Please don’t hesitate to submit your proposal if you haven’t spoken at an InnerSource event before. We are always looking for new and exciting topics and speakers, and want to grow a community at the InnerSource Gathering that is open to new people and ideas, and therefore explicitly encourage first-time speakers to submit their proposals.
If you need help with the CfP process or have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us.
## Speaker perks

As a speaker at the InnerSource Gathering you will of course get a free conference pass for the entire duration of the conference. If you already bought a ticket before your talk was accepted, we will refund the ticket you bought.

# tl;dr

We are looking for talks, workshops & lightning talks on all topics open source collaboration in the corporate context. Your submissions will go through a blind review by our program committee. We will inform you about the status of your session as soon as the review process is concluded.
In case you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us.
You can enter proposals until 2024-12-23 23:59 (Europe/Brussels)

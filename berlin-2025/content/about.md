Co-located with <a href="https://25.foss-backstage.de/">FOSS Backstage</a> the InnerSource Gathering Berlin 2025 brings together <b>practitioners, experts and those new to the InnerSource community</b>. 

We'll start the day with several presentations. After lunch there will be plenty of time to share your stories - both, success and current challenges. In a BarCamp style afternoon we'll learn together how to cross organisational boundaries, reduce silo thinking and establish a InnerSource mindset. 

Not only will that lead to faster innovation cycles, it also lowers the barrier to entry to collaborate upstream and become active members in the open source projects that our businesses rely on.

Looking forward to meeting you next Spring!

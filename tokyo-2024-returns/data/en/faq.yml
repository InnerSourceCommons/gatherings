        The basic rule for handling information at this conference is the Chatham House Rule.
        However, the handling of information varies depending on the content of the session or conversation, so please follow the instructions of the session speaker and the speaker in the end.
        Please check with the information provider if the information can be made public as necessary.

        ##### What is the Chatham House Rule?

        The Chatham House Rule is a principle to promote open discussion at meetings and seminars.
        Participants are free to share information obtained at the meeting externally, but may not reveal the identity of the information provider or the specific meeting at which the information was shared.
        The main purpose of this rule is to provide a safe environment where participants can freely exchange opinions.
        By applying the rule, sensitive information and opinions that are not normally discussed publicly can be more easily shared as anonymity is guaranteed.

Following government and local guidelines, we will prioritize the safety of participants while promoting interaction among InnerSource practitioners.

### Acknowledgements

This event's success would not have been possible without the support of many people:

- All participants
- Speakers who gave excellent presentations
- Sponsors who provided the venue and support (The Linux Foundation, Nifty Corporation, KDDI Agile Development Center Corporation)
- Everyone involved in the community on a regular basis

When we first launched this community, the term "InnerSource" was hardly known in Japan. Now, many people are interested in this concept and have begun implementing it. Thanks to all of you, we were able to further spread the concept and practice of InnerSource in Japan. We sincerely thank you.

**Tsuyoshi Ushio (Sr. Software Engineer at Microsoft)** <br />
**Yuki Hattori (Vice President of the InnerSource Commons Foundation / Sr. Architect at GitHub)**

We will delve deeper into the theme of "welcoming feedback" introduced in Ushio-san's book "Thinking Methods of World-Class Engineers". We will gain insights into mental models and team building from Ushio-san's experiences on how to promote feedback and generate constructive dialogue in organizations. Together with Hattori-san, VP of InnerSource Commons, we will explore the cultivation of organizational culture through feedback.

### Special Session: Breaking Down Silos with InnerSource x Team Topologies

**Ryutaro Yoshiba (Founder and CTO of Attractor Inc)** <br />
**Junya Miyake (KDDI Agile Development Center Corporation)**

In this session, we will delve into the theme of "Team Topologies x InnerSource" through a dialogue between Yoshiba-san and Miyake. Breaking down silos is not simply about "increasing interaction time between teams!", but about appropriate responsibilities and states between teams. We will explore together with you "How can we break down silos and realize more and faster value flow as an organization from the perspectives of InnerSource and Team Topologies?"

### Starting InnerSource from Scratch with a Bottom-Up Approach

**Hajime Komatsu (Nifty Corporation)**

Nifty has been promoting InnerSource adoption from scratch with a bottom-up approach. Although we are still halfway there, the term "InnerSource" is gradually permeating within the company, and collaborations are slowly emerging. In this session, we will share real-life examples of the specific steps we actually took for implementation, the hurdles we faced, and the current challenges we are dealing with. We hope this will provide hints for those who are considering trying InnerSource.

### Collaborative Project Management

**Noriaki Fukuyasu (Japan Representative, The Linux Foundation)**

Open source and InnerSource have a major commonality. That is, they involve collaborative work (collaborative projects) on common significance among stakeholders across organizations that strictly have different goals. What is needed to successfully launch these collaborative projects and continue to provide value to the organization? Collaborative projects involve investment. To find common significance across different organizations and make investment decisions as a company, numbers and mechanisms are necessary.

In this session, based on the author's experience in managing open source projects at the Linux Foundation, we will introduce key points for creating value through cross-organizational collaboration where stakeholders from different organizations find significance, presenting specific examples and methods.

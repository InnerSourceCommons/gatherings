  title : "What is InnerSource"
  content : |
    InnerSource means **cultivating an open source-like culture within a company and creating a culture of transparent collaboration**.<br>
    This concept was proposed by Tim O'Reilly in 2000 as an innovative idea.
    While open source involves sharing source code globally, InnerSource aims to share source code on a large scale within a company.
    As companies grow larger, walls between departments and products can emerge, making collaboration difficult.
    **InnerSource is a groundbreaking effort to solve these challenges by creating a culture of sharing across the entire organization.**
